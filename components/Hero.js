        <figcaption>The text of this poem is animated, gliding through the points of the stone circle.</figcaption>
        <span>I am flitting white moths, the souls of the dead;</span>
        <span>I am the gaping eye that contains all loss;</span>
        <span>I am your lost country, the lover who left;</span>
        <span>I am ice the curlewâ€™s beak cannot penetrate;</span>
        <span>I am unseasonable snow freezing the lapwing chicks;</span>
        <span>I am the smirk, the giggle in sacred places;</span>
        <span>I am the still centre of the hurtling universe;</span>
        <span>I am slow time, the diurnal movement of light and the shadow encroaching lichen-encrusted skin;</span>
        <span>I am the constellations streaming across the heavens;</span>
        <span>I am the rhythm of wingbeats and cries, skeins of migrating geese;</span>
        <span>I am the shaft of sun that enters the stone womb of Maes Howe;</span>
        <span>I am mid-winter solstice when darkness will give way to light.</span>
