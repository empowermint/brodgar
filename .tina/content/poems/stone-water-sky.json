  "title": "Stone, water, sky (Ghazal)",
  "poem": "Did you come by sea or air to stone, water, sky\n\nlike migrating birds or people in skin boats to stone, water, sky?\n\n\nA circle of stones, hands lifted to the heavens:\n\nWhy have you come here to stone, water, sky?\n\n\n\nLike thousands of others 5,000 years ago, drawn\n\nby something they cannot put into words: stone, water, sky.\n\n\nWhy did they raise the stones? A ritual, a ceremony,\n\nfor power or knowledge?  No one knows except stone, water, sky.\n\n\n\nConnecting to the stars: sky eye;  the centre of sea-roads\n\nradiating out to the known world the culture of stone, water, sky.\n\n\nBest come at dawn or dusk, or turn away from the crowds \n\nand wander down to Stenness loch, away from stone, to water and sky.\n\n\n\nListen to birdsong, to the wind, the breath of the world.\n\nDiscover why you have come to stone, water and sky.\n"
