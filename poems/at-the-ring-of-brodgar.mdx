I am flitting white moths, the souls of the dead;
I am the gaping eye that contains all loss;
I am your lost country, the lover who left;
I am ice the curlewâ€™s beak cannot penetrate;
I am unseasonable snow freezing the lapwing chicks;
I am the smirk, the giggle in sacred places;
I am the still centre of the hurtling universe;
I am slow time, the diurnal movement of light and the shadow encroaching lichen-encrusted skin;
I am the constellations streaming across the heavens;
I am the rhythm of wingbeats and cries, skeins of migrating geese;
I am the shaft of sun that enters the stone womb of Maes Howe;
I am mid-winter solstice when darkness will give way to light.
