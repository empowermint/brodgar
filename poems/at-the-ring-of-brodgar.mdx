  <span class="pmd">I am flitting white moths, the souls of the dead;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am the gaping eye that contains all loss;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am your lost country, the lover who left;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am ice the curlewâ€™s beak cannot penetrate;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am unseasonable snow freezing the lapwing chicks;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am the smirk, the giggle in sacred places;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am the still centre of the hurtling universe;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am slow time, the diurnal movement of light and the shadow encroaching lichen-encrusted skin;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am the constellations streaming across the heavens;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am the rhythm of wingbeats and cries, skeins of migrating geese;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am the shaft of sun that enters the stone womb of Maes Howe;<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">I am mid-winter solstice when darkness will give way to light.<br /></span>
