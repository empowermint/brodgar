  title: "Great Yellow Bumblebee: A Spell Against Forgetting"
}

In the warm drowsy breeze
where the bee sucks
smitten, love-drunk,

dreaming deep inside red clover
or on vortices of tiny hurricanes,
weaving from flower to flower:

knapweed, ragwort, yellow rattle, 
oxeye daisies, birdâ€™s foot trefoil
neo-nicotinoid-free

as if summer days
will never cease.

Rare,
oh rare,  
rarest of bees.
