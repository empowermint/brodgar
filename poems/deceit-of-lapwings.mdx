In praise of scatter burst; 
In praise of sky-dancing, soaring, swirling, crazed tumbling;
In praise of leaping with a waver in it; 
In praise of saying it slant, flicker tricks, black/white;
In praise of flop and flip, cool jazzer;
In praise of fashionista green iridescence; a feather in your cap, little prince;
In praise of a mosaic of rough-grazing, pools and damp patches;
In praise of cryptically coloured eggs no longer a gourmet’s delicacy;
In praise of bin men scooping up earthworms, and leatherjackets on cowpats;
In praise of prognosticating plovers of pluvia, latin for ‘rain’;
In praise of distraction, the magician’s art, feigning a broken wing away from your scrape;
In praise of fifths, a song without words;
In praise of a desolate cry.
