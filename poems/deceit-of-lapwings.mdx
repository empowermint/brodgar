### Deceit of Lapwings

  <p>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of scatter burst;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of sky-dancing, soaring, swirling, crazed tumbling;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of leaping with a waver in it;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of saying it slant, flicker tricks, black/white;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of flop and flip, cool jazzer;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of fashionista green iridescence; a feather in your cap, little prince;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of a mosaic of rough-grazing, pools and damp patches;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of cryptically coloured eggs no longer a gourmet’s delicacy;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of bin men scooping up earthworms, and leatherjackets on cowpats;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of prognosticating plovers of *pluvia*, Latin for ‘rain’;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of distraction, the magician’s art, feigning a broken wing away from your scrape;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of fifths, a song without words;<br /></span>
    <span class="pmd">In praise of a desolate cry.<br /></span>
