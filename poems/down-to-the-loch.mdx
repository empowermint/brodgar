}

glimpse: black-tip of ear twitch, a hare-witch, mercurial jinks and flip,
turning on a sixpence

swirl: sky-lark dervish; the fan snapped shut
of the drumming snipe

scratch: a glisk, calligraphy of light 
etching the clouds

snag: angels shimmy shimmy on the loch,
pock-marked by the unbelief of rain

glow:  the hills, Ward and Culag sky made solid, pale blue
or dark as storm clouds

folding, unfolding:
waves - as the wind shifts and the waters rise

pulse: the plaint of oystercatchers, lapping of the loch, wind in the reeds,
your heart beat.
