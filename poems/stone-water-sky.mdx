  title: "Sky, water, stone"
}

Did you come by sea or by air to sky, water, stone  
like people in skin boats or migrating birds?  

Why is it for 5,000 years, you and thousands  
of others are drawn by the power of stone?  

A circle of stones: hands lifted to the heavens.  
What cries out in the silence of stone?  

Enclosed by water, open to the sky,  
communing with the stars: sky eye of stone.  

Perhaps you will be changed by sky, water, stone.  
Listen to birdsong and the wind, the breath of the world.
