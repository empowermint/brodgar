### Sky, water, stone

<p>
  <span class="pmd">Did you come by sea or by air to sky, water, stone<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">like people in skin boats or migrating birds?<br /></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="pmd">Why is it for 5,000 years, you and thousands<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">of others are drawn by the power of stone?<br /></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="pmd">A circle of stones: hands lifted to the heavens.<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">What cries out in the silence of stone?<br /></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="pmd">Enclosed by water, open to the sky,<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">communing with the stars: sky eye of stone.<br /></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span class="pmd">Perhaps you will be changed by sky, water, stone.<br /></span>
  <span class="pmd">Listen to birdsong and the wind, the breath of the world.<br /></span>
</p>
