# How to

Rewilding: Brodgar Umbrella Poetry/Sound Walk (Orkney) can be experienced in three ways: 
 
1. In person at the Ring of Brodgar and the surrounding RSPB Brodgar Nature Reserve listening to the recordings  within a special wind-resistant sound umbrella fitted with tiny loudspeakers for an immersive experience;
2. In person listening to the recordings using your own smartphone and headphones;
3. At home or anywhere you can access the Internet, view the website to read the text of the poems and listen to the poetry/sound recordings.

## Sound Umbrellas

In advance where you can access Internet. Go on Brodgar page on St Magnus website. [Download map of the Brodgar site.](https://www.rspb.org.uk/globalassets/downloads/documents/reserves/brodgar-trail-guide.pdf)

At the site: collect an umbrella from the HES (Historic Environment Scotland) trailer (over the road from the  carpark at the start of the path leading to the Ring of Brodgar.) Pay deposit. The umbrellas are fitted with tiny loudspeakers. The advantage of this is that as you walk, enclosed in a transparent umbrella, you will have an immersive experience.

The sound umbrellas will be available only on Saturday and Sunday, 17th and 18th June, 2023. From 12am-4 pm, umbrellas to be returned by 3.45pm. TBC The recordings last c. 25 minutes.

You can visit the Ring of Brodgar and Nature Reserve at any time you like the entire week of the St Magnus Festival. If you can, go at dawn (or at least early morning) or dusk (half an hour before sunset) to avoid the crowds and maybe hear a few real birds as well as those on the recordings.
