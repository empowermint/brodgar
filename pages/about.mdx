# About

Rewilding: Brodgar Poetry/Sound Walk is a new multimedia installation centred on recordings of original poetry by poet Stephanie Green and natural sound recordings (wind, waves, birdsong) by sound artist, Sonja Heyer.  You can listen to recordings through your own headphones or an optional  sound umbrella as you go on a walk, starting at the iconic Neolithic stonehenge, the Ring of Brodgar, walk into the RSPB Brodgar Reserve down through a wildflower meadow to Loch Stenness, returning to feel the mystical power of the Ring of Brodgar or you can listen at home via this website.

The sequence  seeks to draw attention to the plight of endangered species of birds and creatures in particular the curlew, the lapwing and the great yellow bumblebee and to celebrate the success of the RSPB since buying the land in 2001 for the Brodgar Nature Reserve and creating a rewilded habitat to provide a safe haven. There are many other endangered species here such as the skylark, snipe, redshank, oystercatcher and the hare more briefly mentioned. So the poems are both a celebration of the wonder and beauty of these birds and creatures but also a lament for their continued danger of extinction throughout Europe due to a destruction of their habitat and climate change.

There will also be a wider, more spiritual context (save our souls as well as save the planet) referencing, how could we not,  the Ring of Brodgar which is at the centre of the reserve.   There will also be a nod to Orkney dialect (also a celebration/lament for an endangered language) by using the Orcadian names for birds in one poem but the poems are otherwise in English accessible to all, including children over the age of 9.

The poems in Brodgar have been ‘re-wilded’ in that they are inspired by bird song or bird flight, images like scatter-bursts or chants and spells, rather than traditional poetry forms such as sonnets or rhymed stanza. Some are inspired by more ancient forms such as a Persian ghazal, though a broken one, or the ancient Irish poet, Amergin. The rewilding of the poetry reflects the rewilding of the RSPB Reserve to attract back endangered species.

The Ring of Brodgar and Brodgar Nature Reserve, Orkney are on Mainland Orkney, on a thin isthmus of land between two lochs, Harry and Stenness. A mosaic of rare and fragile habitats, it supports hundreds of species of flora and fauna, many rare or threatened and reliant on protection and careful management for their survival. These habitats are nationally and internationally recognised as vital in supporting large numbers of resident and migratory birds.

Brodgar Poetry/Sound walk is supported by Creative Scotland who financed a week’s residency at the Brodgar site in July 2022 for Stephanie Green to research and develop ideas for poetry and for Sonja Heyer to take natural sound recordings on site. The RSPB Orkney ranger, Sarah Money and HES ranger, Sandra Miller provided invaluable advice and we are grateful for their continuing support.
