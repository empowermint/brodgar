# Who

‘Rewilding’ is Stephanie and Sonja’s second collaboration creating a poetry/sound walk. The first in 2018 was about the history of Berlin through its water, Stephanie’s poetry accompanied by site-specific natural water recordings from the river Spree by Sonja listened to by participants within sound umbrellas on a self-directed walk through a park in Kreuzberg.  The unusual sight of people walking around listening to something within transparent umbrellas was so intriguing it attracted many people in the park to participate. Sonja Heyer has become known for her many ‘Umbrella’ sound collaborations in Germany and Taiwan.  She has visited Orkney many times and was particularly keen for her and Stephanie’s next collaboration to be on Orkney. 

Stephanie has been visiting Orkney for many years including self-imposed writer’s retreats on Papa Westray, Sanday and North Ronaldsay. She attended the St Magnus Writers course, 2013 tutored by Jen Hadfield and Pamela Beasant. As part of this she was paired with Marisa Sharon Hartanto on the Young Composers’ course who composed music for voice and piano for a verse from one of Stephanie’s  poems, performed by mezzo soprano Alison Wells in the Peedie Kirk. Two of her poems were also published in the celebratory programme of the 40th Anniversary of the festival, 2016.
