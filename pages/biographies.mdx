‘Brodgar’ is Stephanie and Sonya’s second collaboration creating a poetry/sound walk. The first in 2018 was about the history of Berlin through its water, Stephanie’s poetry accompanied by site-specific natural water recordings by Sonja. It was entitled ‘Berlin Umbrella’ because participants listened to recordings from within special sound umbrellas. The unusual sight of people walking around listening to something within transparent umbrellas was so intriguing it attracted many people in the park to participate. The success of this Berlin collaboration has led to this second one at Brodgar, Orkney.

Stephanie has been visiting Orkney for many years including self-imposed writer’s retreats on Papa Westray, Sanday and North Ronaldsay. She attended the St Magnus Writers course, 2013 tutored by Jen Hadfield and Pamela Beasant. As part of this she was paired with Marisa Sharon Hartanto on the Young Composers’ course who composed music for voice and piano for a verse from one of Stephanie’s  poems, performed by mezzo soprano Alison Wells in the Peedie Kirk. Two of her poems were also published in the celebratory programme of the 40th Anniversary of the festival, 2016.

## Why it is Important

‘I am conscious of climate change, as are so many other people, and also the threat to  endangered species partly due to this but also to manmade loss of habitat.  As other disasters take centre stage in the media, I feel it is important to bring the public’s attention back to saving our planet. However, I do not think ranting and raving is the way, but rather through evoking a sense of wonder at the beauty of nature. Sonja and I both love Orkney and feel this is the ideal place to create such a work which will immerse participants in an experience of the creatures, especially lapwing and curlews.’ Stephanie Green.  

Sonja Heyer has visited Orkney many times and was particularly keen for her and Stephanie’s next collaboration to be on Orkney. Her site-specific sound recordings this time are of wind, birdsong and other natural sounds at the Ring of Brodgar and Reserve or other places on Mainland Orkney such as the Sound Wall at the Loons and these have been blended with percussion, some song with Stephanie’s poetry. Not being an ornithologist, and only being able to visit in her school summer holidays when few birds were to be found on the Brodgar site, much of the bird song has been sourced online from xeno-canto.
